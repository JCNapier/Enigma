# Enigma

## Functionality: 3 
- My enigma encrypt and decrypt methods are successfully implemented. My command line interfaces work, and are properly functioning. However, I noticed even though my time is being formatted correctly, it is not returning the correct string to the CLI at the time a message is encrypted. I started to fix it but breaking things down into more helper methods, but my project at this point is entangled to the point where I didn't feel I had the time to properly fix it last night when I found it. 

## OOP: 3 
- My Enigma project is properly brokne into smaller logical componets that are encapsulated in other classes. I did not use a module. I have two methods longer than 10 lines. 

## Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: 3 
- My Enigma project syntax, spacing, and indentation is consistent across the project. My naming convention, variables, and file names follow convention. I also implemented an aplhabet hash to apply my shifts. I have two methods slightl

## TDD: 3
- I didn't use ant mocks or stubs on this project. Every method is tested, and there is one line that is not being hit on my simplecov. I am getting 99.5 percent in my simplecov.
